*Tell your politicians your thoughts the minute you read something online with the TellMyPolitician Button or Bookmarklet.*

TellMyPolitician is the simplest way for citizens to contact their politicians. TellMyPolitician facilitates interaction between politicians and citizens when the citizen is most likely to take action -- when they're reading or watching the news. When a user wants to contact their politician about something they read or watched online they simply:

1.  Click on the TellMyPolitician button that the publisher places on their site along with their other Social Bookmark tools or they click on our bookmarklet in their browser's toolbar.
2.  They then type their address in the search box and choose which politician to contact, whether by phone, fax, mail, twitter, or email.
3.  If they choose to write their politician an email, they are led to the politician's contact form where they can use the TellMyPolitician toolbar to copy and paste the url of the article that prompted them to contact their politician.

Publishers can help users contact their politician by simply adding our button to their site. This button acts just like a Digg, Reddit, or StumbleUpon button; but instead of sharing a publisher's content across the web, citizens will be using TellMyPolitician buttons to contact their representatives. When there is no button, citizens can use our bookmarklet to reach their politician from any webpage. [Add TellMyPolitician to your site today](http://tellmypolitician.com/siteinstructions).
